Define Your Goals and Audience:

Clearly outline the purpose of your architecture attraction site. Is it for promoting a specific architectural landmark, showcasing various architectural styles, or providing information about the profession? Identify your target audience.
Research and Content Planning:

Gather information about the architectural attractions you want to feature on your site. This could include historical details, architectural styles, notable architects, and any other relevant information. Plan the structure and layout of your content.
Choose a Domain Name and Hosting:

Select a memorable and relevant domain name for your site. Choose a reliable hosting provider that meets your needs in terms of bandwidth, storage, and other technical requirements.
Select a Content Management System (CMS):

Choose a CMS like WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal to make it easier to manage and update your site. WordPress is particularly popular and user-friendly.
Design and Development:

Design a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Consider hiring a professional web designer if needed. Ensure that your site is responsive, meaning it works well on different devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
Implement the design using HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. If you're using a CMS, customize the theme to match your design.
