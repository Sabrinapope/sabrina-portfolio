Angelique is not just a makeup artist; she is a magician who transforms faces into living canvases. With a passion for colors and an innate sense of style, she has turned her love for makeup into an art form that speaks volumes.

Whether it's creating a glamorous red carpet look, a flawless bridal ensemble, or a daring editorial masterpiece, Angelique has the Midas touch. Her attention to detail, coupled with an understanding of individual styles, ensures that each client walks away not just looking beautiful but feeling confident and empowered.

What sets Angelique apart is not just her technical prowess but the genuine love she has for her craft. Having worked with her in our previous corporate life, I witnessed the seamless transition from boardroom to beauty room. Her journey is a testament to the fact that passion knows no bounds, and a career change can be a beautiful rebirth.

I've created a custom landing page for this artist that links back to her portfolio!
